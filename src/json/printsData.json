        "My favourite picture of my collection & one of the most memorable experiences of my life. A rare day off work in January, I took a drive to what is now my favourite place on the planet, Glen Coe. After 2 and a a half hours of driving, I took a turn off on to a single track road towards Loch Etive, as I rounded the corner, I saw this chap standing and watching a few meters from the roadside. I pulled up and got out, much to my surprise he stuck around for an hour. No car nose, people or anything to distract, just myself, Dave & the beautiful valley of Glen Etive.",

The wind, infact all conditions, were perfect, I crept my way from one end of a narrow woodland to the field on the other side, before spotting this Juvenile & its mother grazing their way up towards me. After a short wait, the two got within 6-8 meters, Although the Roe is looking at me in the picture, I went undetected & the pair went on about their day.",
